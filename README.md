# neverpanic

This is the next generation of error handling in JavaScript. How many times have you gotten out of bed, ready to get on with your day, only to find that you have 1243 Sentry alerts because you forgot to gracefuly handle an exception in your NodeJS backend. The truth is, these are not exceptions, these are panics. Panics not just in your code, but also to your mental health.

Try neverpanic, and live a zen life.
